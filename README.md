# Fake News Detector Project

This project implements a browser extension that detects fake news using a hybrid approach involving:
1. Content Extraction and Preprocessing
2. Content-Based Analysis (using advanced NLP and deep learning models)
3. Source Credibility Assessment
4. Cross-Referencing with Trusted Sources
5. A Composite Decision Engine

It also reserves a folder for future integration of the DeepSeek API.
